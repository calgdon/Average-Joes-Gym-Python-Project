# python-project

Average Joes Gym

This solo, full-stack project was undertaken on completion of the four week Python module with CodeClan.  The technologies utilised were as follows:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Python
    - Flask
    - PostgreSQL

The aim of the project was to create a full stack web application to be utilised by staff within a gym. The MVP for the project was:

- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Members
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Classes
- The app should allow the gym to book members on specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are booked in for a particular class

I modelled the web application on Average Joe's Gym from the film Dodgeball.
