Average Joes Gym

This project was completed at the end of the four week Python course on starting CodeClan. 

I modelled the web application on Average Joe's Gym from the film Dodgeball. 

It was a solo project making a full-stack application.

The MVP for the project was as follows:

- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Members
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Classes
- The app should allow the gym to book members on specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are booked in for a particular class
